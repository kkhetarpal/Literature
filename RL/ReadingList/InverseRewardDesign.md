# Inverse Reward Design
Xiaoxiao Guo, Satinder Singh, Richard Lewis, Honglak Lee, 2016

## Summary

**Key Contribution:** 
  * The authors introduce Inverse Reward Design which deals with observing the designer's rewards and inputs and estimating the true reward.
  * Main motivation is that a designer might want to convey something with the designed reward but the interpreted reward by the agent is not the same as *intended*
  * Estimating the true reward could tackle problems in reward-misspecification and reward hacking
