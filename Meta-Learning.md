# Meta-Learning : Learning to learn 

## Attempting to learn about meta-learning approaches

- Conventional approach to learning 
  - In supervised deep learning approaches computers have been trained on a humungous labeled dataset to enable learning of
  features to perform on various computer vision tasks like image classification, digit recognition, pose estimation, etc. For a AI system to 
  correctly classify a 'cat' in an image, it is trained with several forms (colors, textures, poses, etc.) of cats to be able to 'generalize' and learn 'what a cat is ".
