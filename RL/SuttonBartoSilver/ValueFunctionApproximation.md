# Value Function Approximation
## Summary Notes

## Lecture 6 - David Silver 

**Why Value Function - Are Tabular Methods not enough?**
- Apart from small grid worlds and small dimensions of four room toy problems, RL can be used to solve very large scale problems. Tabular methods are limited to the memory, computation expense and hence can only deal with small scale set up. Few examples of problems being large-scale are the game of backgammon (10^20 states), Alpha Go (10^170 states), and continuous state spaces such as in Helicopter flying, driving scenarios, to name a few.
- Instead value functions could be estimated in a way such that they can scale up and generalize across states. 

**How can we scale up model-free prediction and control methods ?**
