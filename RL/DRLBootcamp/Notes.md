- [x] What is an MDP 
  - Set of states S,
  - Set of actions A
  - Transition function *P(s' | s, a)*
  - Reward function *R(s,a,s')*
  - Start state *s0*
  - Discount factor *y*
  - Horizon *H*
  - Policy 
  - Goal 
- [x] Success Stories from RL
- [x] RL Algorithms Landscape
- [x] Optimal Control 
  Given an MDP (S,A,P,R,y,H) find the optimal policy the one that maximizes the expected reward
