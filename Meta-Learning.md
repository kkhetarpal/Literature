# Meta-Learning : Learning to learn 

## Attempting to learn about meta-learning approaches

**Conventional approach to learning** 

In supervised deep learning approaches computers have been trained on a humungous labeled dataset to enable learning of features to perform on various computer vision tasks like image classification, digit recognition, pose estimation, etc. For a AI system to correctly classify a 'cat' in an image, it is trained with several forms (colors, textures, poses, etc.) of cats to be able to 'generalize' and learn 'what a cat is ".

However, the same is not at all true for human brain. We are able to identify a 'cat' from even the cat in a pose we have never seen before (say upside down). A more concrete example is as Chelsea Finn describes in her [[blog post]] (http://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2017/07/18/learning-to-learn).
